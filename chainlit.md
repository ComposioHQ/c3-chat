## Workflow:

1. 👋 Users initiate interaction via the Chainlit chat interface.
2. 🔑 Users authenticate securely with GitHub through Composio's OAuth integration.
3. 💬 Users submit natural language requests.
4. 🧠 Claude intelligently processes these requests and identifies when GitHub tools are needed.
5. 🔄 Composio securely manages authenticated API interactions with GitHub.
6. 📊 Results from GitHub are returned to Claude for further processing.
7. 💌 The final, refined response is presented back to the user through Chainlit.

## Getting Started 🚀

Simply authenticate with GitHub using the provided button when prompted, and begin interacting with your repositories, issues, pull requests, and more through natural language!

## Behind the Scenes 🔍

This demo highlights Composio's powerful capability to manage OAuth authentication flows and maintain secure connections with third-party services. Combined with Claude's sophisticated reasoning and direct GitHub integration, it provides a seamless and secure experience for developing and deploying authenticated AI assistants.

Happy coding! 🎉👩‍💻👨‍💻
